# react-native-fields

The idea of this `react-native-fields` is to simplify the managing of fields like Input, checkboxes, etc. Generally, when we create fields in react native, we usually create `state` variables, if there are more fields then it will become more repetitive work to create each state variable and update everytime.

### What am I trying to solve with `react-native-fields` ?

1. No need to create state variables. `react-native-fields` shoudl auto handle the states.
2. The styles of each field should be dynamic.
3. Every field should be able to perform in relation to the other fields.
4. The fields creation should stay isolated from the code. 
5. Any validation code should work with the fields.
6. The placements of fields should be easy in both `horizontal` and `vertical`
